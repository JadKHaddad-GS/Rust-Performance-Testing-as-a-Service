# Performace Testing as a Service
Built to run on Kubernetes, this service is designed to test the performance of given applications using locust.
## TODO

Remove "Unwraps"<br>
Other features..<br>
Save everything in master, run thread in worker, update through redis channel on updates or every 10 secs in the thread, request lock and unlock projects, hmm..
